BF: synthetics: annotate, correction for empty values
    No output of annotation for empty values, preventing empty entities.
BF: Optimization Backward compatibility Python < 3.13.x
CR: synthetics: Omission of the backslash to control whitespaces
    The backslash (\) at the end of a line to control whitespace has been
    omitted. Line breaks and surrounding spaces are collapsed into a single
    space. Then use the whitespace control syntax of Jinja: e.g. {%- ... -%}.

CR: synthetics: Optimization of placeholder resolution
    Improved recursive usage (placeholders use preceding placeholders)

1.1.0 20250823
BF: units Corrections/optimizations of categorization
    The short RegEx was incorrectly prioritized instead of the qualified one.
    e.g. mph (as m), was not correctly determined as length + time
    or dB (as B), was incorrectly assigned to acoustics + it + storage
