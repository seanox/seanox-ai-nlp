1.4.0 2025xxxx
CR: logics: Added to create a logical structure for natural language input

1.3.0 20251001
BF: Python: Corrections/optimizations of dependencies
BF: synthetics: Correction for empty templates / missing segments
BF: synthetics: Consistent use of the parameter pattern for RegEx in spans
CR: Python: Increased the requirement to Python 3.10 or higher
CR: synthetics: Added schema and validation for template YAML
CR: synthetics: Added custom filters for template rendering
    Optional custom filters for template rendering. Keys are filter names (str),
    and values are callable objects (callables) that implement the filter.
    synthetics(
      datasource: str,
      template: str,
      data: dict[str, Any],
      filters: dict[str, Callable] = None
    ) -> Synthetic
CR: synthetics: Template section span - regex added support for labels
    The syntax ${label} can now be used as a placeholder that will be replaced
    with the values defined for that label.

1.2.0 20250906
BF: synthetics: annotate, correction for empty values
    No output of annotation for empty values, preventing empty entities.
BF: Optimization Backward compatibility Python < 3.13.x
CR: synthetics: Omission of the backslash to control whitespaces
    The backslash (\) at the end of a line to control whitespace has been
    omitted. Line breaks and surrounding spaces are collapsed into a single
    space. Then use the whitespace control syntax of Jinja: e.g. {%- ... -%}.
    https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/templates/#whitespace-control
CR: synthetics: Optimization of placeholder resolution
    Improved recursive usage (placeholders use preceding placeholders)

1.1.0 20250823
BF: units Corrections/optimizations of categorization
    The short RegEx was incorrectly prioritized instead of the qualified one.
    e.g. mph (as m), was not correctly determined as length + time
    or dB (as B), was incorrectly assigned to acoustics + it + storage

CR: units Renaming of the UNIT-VALUE label to MEASURE
    MEASURE is more intuitive in spaCy/NLP than UNIT-VALUE.
CR: units Added unit hl / hL for Hectoliters
CR: units Separation of SI prefixes: Multiples / Submultiples
    - Minimizes edge cases such as "das" (deca second)
      which are theoretically possible but not relevant
CR: synthetics: Added to generate semantic sentences
