# Introduction

Natural-language input often contains implicit logical relations that are
difficult to capture in a structured and reproducible way. Phrases like
_"Compare A, B, and C but not D and E or F and G."_ encode nested combinations
of inclusion and exclusion, which are rarely made explicit in conventional
retrieval workflows.

The __Semantic Logic Composer__ provides a __rule-based__ approach to extracting
such logical structures. It identifies entities within free-text input and
represents their relations through operators like __AND__, __OR__, and __NOT__.
The resulting structure can be expressed in formats such as SQL, JSON, or YAML,
providing a basis that downstream components may use for retrieval or filtering.

The module is intended as a lightweight component within an NLP pipeline. It
works independently of large language models (LLMs) and produces a transparent,
deterministic logical structure that downstream components can consume and
apply. Its design emphasizes auditability and adaptability, allowing
practitioners to control which entities are considered relevant and which are
explicitly excluded. The implementation relies on [stanza](
    https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/) with [Universal Dependencies](
https://universaldependencies.org/) to create the structured entity
representations on which the Composer operates.

This approach is neither complete nor perfect and will never replace a large
language model (LLM) -- natural language is simply too complex for exhaustive
coverage. Instead, it offers a practical and extensible foundation for building
interpretable retrieval logic.

# Known Limitations

# Usage

# Benchmark

The benchmark tests were conducted on a system running Windows 11 with an Intel
Core i5-12400 and 16 GB of RAM. The templates used for evaluation included
conditional logic, loops, randomization, and annotated entities, representing a
moderately complex structure typical for synthetic text generation. The focus
was on measuring text throughput during large-scale data generation, excluding
I/O and external dependencies.
