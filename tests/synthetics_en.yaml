# During template validation, fields may be undefined if no data is provided.
# This becomes problematic when those fields are used in functions rather than
# just printed. To prevent errors during validation, default values are
# assigned. These defaults ensure the template compiles correctly but are
# ignored during actual rendering.

# In addition to named entities, custom spans can be defined between entities
